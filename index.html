            <p>It's nice to see you at my page!<br>
            My name is Nastya Boksha and I've just started 
            my path as a frontend-developer! Let's get acquainted!</p>

            <p>I'm really happy to be part of rolling-scopes course and I'm willing to take the most of it.</p>

            <p>Learning has always been so much fun for me! When I was smaller I used to think about programming as
                a rocket-science (now sometimes I think about it the same way, though), but when I actually tried
                doing something myself it just worked out perfectly. I was sooo excited and I am still.

            <p>Every day I try to discover things about coding. University helps me a lot, cause I study 
                at the BSUIR. So at the beggining I got acquainted with C, then I dug deeper into Java, 
                now I'm really into frontend-development and I hope eventually it would become my future career.

            <p>I am a good learner, I have a good memory and I'm curious about stuff. I never give up until I see the 
                essence of things. I'm ready to face all the challenges and to successfully overcome them.
